My extensions and dataproviders for zeitgeist

For modules:
You can run any module (*source/__init__.py: ie: python mpris2source/__init__.py)
This commonly do the same as plugin do but standalone

For zeitgeist plugins: 
copy files to $HOME/.local/share/zeitgeist/extensions/
And restart reitgeist daemon

For Gnome Activity Journal:
copy gaj_*.py files to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-activity-journal/plugins/
And restar GAJ
