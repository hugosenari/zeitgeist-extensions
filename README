My extensions and dataproviders for zeitgeist

For zeitgeist plugins: 
copy files to $HOME/.local/share/zeitgeist/extensions/
And restart reitgeist daemon

For Gnome Activity Journal:
copy gaj_*.py files to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-activity-journal/plugins/
And restar GAJ


mpris2source:
Base code to create dataproviders extension with mpris.
Require https://github.com/hugosenari/mpris2 and https://github.com/hugosenari/pydbusdecorator

gmusicbrowser:
Is a dataprovider extension to register songs played with gmusicbrowser.
Require mpris2source.py
For some reason Activity Journal doesn't show this logs, but Synapse shows.
I wrote one perl version of this but for some reason dbus module for perl don't work properly 

pidgin:
Is a dataprovider extension to register new messages received from pidgin
Require pydbusdecorator
Maybe make more sense place it on pidgin, but I don't want to rewrite in c or perl :P
