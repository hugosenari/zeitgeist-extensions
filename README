mpris2:
Is a dataprovider extension to register songs played with any running mpri2 media player.
Require mpris2source

gmusicbrowser:

I wrote one perl version of this but for some reason dbus module for perl don't work properly 

pidgin:

Maybe make more sense place it on pidgin, but I don't want to rewrite in c :P
